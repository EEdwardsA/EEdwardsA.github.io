title: About me

Passionate about public policy, evidenced-based decision-making, and improving autonomy and well-being for all sapient beings.

### My story

Once upon a time, I was a hardcore ideologue. Then I read more about [confronting my own cognitive biases](https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/original-sequences) and had to basically build a new epistemology and worldview from scratch. I served in elected office for four years, then decided to pivot out of public-facing roles and become a data scientist.
